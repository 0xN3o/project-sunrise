          During the crypto bear market, many began to question the purpose and
          sustainability of blockchain technology, with some even calling it a
          scam. Products born out of blockchain technology, such as Non-Fungible
          Tokens (NFTs), were met with ridicule as well. However, at Project
          Sunrise, we are set on proving the usefulness of blockchain
          technology, and specifically using NFTs as a tool to provide utility
          and purpose.

        <p className="mt-4">
          In keeping with the spirit of blockchain and Satoshi's peer-to-peer
          monetary network, we have created an experimental pre-programmed
          protocol that allows every participant to be a part of a growing
          network and be rewarded for their involvement. NFTs are just one tool
          used in this project, serving as a record on the blockchain to prove
          the existence of users. It's important to note that this is not an NFT
          project, as we are not selling digital art or other non-essential
          items.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          This is just the first step, we welcome other developers to continue
          to create new use cases by leveraging on our smart contract. We
          believe in a truly decentralized world led by the community.

          Project sunrise is a social experiment that is built on the blockchain
          to explore the concept of interconnectedness and how far a small
          action can ripple through a network of people. It also demonstrates
          the potential of blockchain technology to incentivize and reward
          individuals for participating in a network.

        <p className="mt-4">
          Project Sunrise smart contract is deployed on the BNB Chain, which
          uses BNB cryptocurrency, one of the top 5 cryptocurrencies by market
          cap. The contract is verified and open for everyone to review. Every
          single BNB collected from each holder is given back to the holder
          before as a referral incentive. There is no centralized organization,
          person or company that governs the process. It is a fully autonomous
          and decentralized protocol without enriching anyone in particular.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          We hope that the community will support this experiment and continue
          to build functions and use cases around the platform by leveraging on
          our smart contract.

          In conclusion, this social experiment is a creative way to study human
          behavior and the power of social networks. It also showcases the
          potential of blockchain technology in creating new incentives and
          reward systems. This experiment is a perfect example of how blockchain
          technology can be used to drive social change and create new
          opportunities for individuals.
